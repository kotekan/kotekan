/**
 * @class gpuCommand
 * @brief Base class for defining commands to execute on GPUs
 *
 * Commands executed on a GPU can either be kernels that perform a simple calculation
 * or resource management instructions to support kernel execution, generally these
 * break down into three categories, copy-in, copy-out, and kernels.
 *
 * @conf buffer_depth          The number of GPU frames used for pipelining commands
 * @conf kernel                Filename, if an external file (CL, binary, etc) is used.
 * @conf kernel_path           If an external file is used, this gives the path to search.
 * @conf command               The name used by this kernel internally for logging,
 *                             and also the name of the kernel function (where that applies).
 * @conf profiling             Enable the recording of the command runtime
 * @conf frame_arrival_period  The time between frames, used for some profiling functions
