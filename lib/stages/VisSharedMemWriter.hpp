/**
 * @class VisSharedMemWriter
 * @brief Export calibration data out to a shared memory region
 *
 * This stage is an improvement upon visCalWriter. It exports the
 * most recent samples of the calibration data stream to a
 * fixed-length ring-buffer-like shared memory region.
 *
 * The shared memory region is composed of a Structured Data Region
 * (summarises the structure for the data), an Access Record region
 * (records the writer's access to the Data region), and the Data region
 * (ring buffer which contains the data and metadata from the frame).
 *
 * The structure of the shared memory region can be seen in the figure in
 * this issue: https://github.com/kotekan/kotekan/issues/692.
 *
 * The first section of the structured data region contains 0 if if the stage
 * is gracefully shut down. Otherwise, it will contain the number of writes.
 *
 * To ensure the ability to read while the stage is continuously
 * writing to the file, readers can inspect the access record to assess
 * the validity of the data. The access record has a 1:1 correlation to
 * the Data region. Every time the Data is modified, the access record
 * will have the timestamp of modification. While data is written,
 * its access record will be set to -1. Acquiring a semaphore, with the
 * same name as the shared memory region is required before reading
 * from or writing to the access record. The Data region is lock free.
 *
 * This stage writes out the data it receives with minimal processing.
 * Removing certain fields from the output must be done in a prior
 * transformation.
 *
 * A Valve stage should be added before this buffer process
 * to prevent data backing up during semaphore deadlocks.
 *
 * To obtain the metadata about the stream received usage of the datasetManager
 * is required.
 *
 * The dataset ID can be changed in the incoming stream. However, structural
 * parameters that could affect the size of the data cannot be adjusted without
 * triggering a FATAL_ERROR. By default these are `input`, `frequencies`, `products`,
 * `stack`, `eigenvalues`, and `metadata`. This list can be *added* to using the config
 * variable `critical_states`. Any state change not considered critical
 * will continue as normal.
 *
 * @par Buffers
 * @buffer in_buf The buffer streaming data to write
 *          @buffer_format VisBuffer structured
 *          @buffer_metadata VisMetadata
 *
 * @conf    root_path       String. Location in filesystem containing
 *                          shared memory and semaphore.
 * @conf    name           Name of shared memory region and semaphore.
 * @conf    num_samples        Number of time samples stored in ring buffer.
 * @conf    wait_time   Maximum time that the writer will wait to
 *                          unlock a semaphore. If it hits the limit
 *                          Kotekan will shut down the stage.
 * @conf    critical_states List of strings. A list of state types to consider
 *                          critical. That is, if they change in the incoming
 *                          data stream then Kotekan will shut down.
 *
 * @par Metrics
 * @metric dropped_frame_counter
 *          The number of times a frame was dropped because it arrived too late.
 * @metric  access_record_wait_time_seconds
 *          The amount of time the writer spent, in seconds waiting to
 *          access the access record.
