/**
 * @class networkInputPowerStream
 * @brief Stage to take an intensity stream and stream to a remote client.
 *
 * This is a consumer stage which takes intensity data from a buffer and streams
 * it via TCP (and some day UDP) to a remote client, primarily for visualization purposes.
 *
 * In TCP mode, the stage should continually attempt to establish a TCP connection,
 * then transmit data once successful.
 *
 * @par Buffers
 * @buffer out_buf Input kotekan buffer containing power data to be sent.
 *     @buffer_format Array of @c uint
 *     @buffer_metadata none
 *
 * @conf   samples_per_data_set   Int. Number of time samples to sum.
 * @conf   integration_length     Int. Number of time samples to sum.
 * @conf   num_freq               Int. Number of time samples to sum.
 * @conf   num_elements           Int. Number of time samples to sum.
 * @conf   port                   Int. Number of time samples to sum.
 * @conf   ip                     Int. Number of time samples to sum.
 * @conf   protocol               String. Should be @c "TCP" or @c "UDP"
 *
 * @warning UDP stream receiption doesn't work at the moment.
 * @note    Lots of updating required once buffers are typed...
