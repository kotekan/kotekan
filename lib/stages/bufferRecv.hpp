/**
 * @brief Receives frames and metadata from other networked kotekan buffers,
 *        and puts them into a local kotekan buffer.
 *
 * This stage takes frames from one more more sources and places them into the
 * @c buf for use by other local consumer stages. There is no guarantee regarding
 * the order the frames will arrvive in.  However all frames will be valid, which is to
 * say they will contain the full set of data sent by the client, or they will not be
 * added to the output buffer.
 *
 * This system works with libevent to do event driven async I/O with worker threads to support
 * higher bandwidth than one thread alone could support.  In libevent terms there is one base
 * thread, and @c num_threads worker threads which handle the libevent callbacks.
 *
 * @par buffers
 * @buffer buf The buffer which accepts new frames (producer)
 *        @buffer_format any
 *        @buffer_metadata any
 *
 * @conf listen_port         Int, default 11024.  The port to listen for new connections
 * @conf num_threads         Int, default 1.  The number of worker threads to use
 * @conf connection_timeout  Int, default 60.  Number of seconds before timeout on transfer
 *
 * @par Metrics
 * @metric kotekan_buffer_recv_transfer_time_seconds
 *         The amount of time it took in seconds to transfer the last frame from the
 *         host given by the @c source label
 * @metric kotekan_buffer_recv_dropped_frame_total
 *         The number of times a frame was dropped because the @c buf was full at the time
 *         a block of was aviable to transfer to it.
 *
 * @todo Possibly factor out the threadpool.
 * @todo Allow for a different log level for workers from the main thread.
