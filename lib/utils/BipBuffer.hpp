/**
 * @class BipBuffer
 * @brief A single-producer single-consumer circular buffer that always supports writing a
 * contiguous chunk of data.
 *
 * BipBuffer, short of "bipartite buffer", is a data structure first described by Simon Cooke
 * (https://www.codeproject.com/articles/3479/the-bip-buffer-the-circular-buffer-with-a-twist). This
 * version is based on a lockless implementation described by Andrea Lattuada and James Munns
 * (https://andrea.lattuada.me/blog/2019/the-design-and-implementation-of-a-lock-free-ring-buffer-with-contiguous-reservations.html).
 *
 * This design facilitates operating on the buffer by two threads, one doing the writing, and the
 * other the reading. These threads don't work on the buffer directly, but instead use the
 * `BipBufferWriter` and `BipBufferReader` classes, respectively.
