/**
 * @struct Buffer
 * @brief Kotekan's core multi-producer, multi-consumer ring buffer with metadata
 *
 * This class is the central method for passing data between kotekan stages
 * in a pipeline.
 *
 * It provides a fixed size RING buffer which can have multiple producers and
 * consumers attached to it.   The idea is that individual stages do not need
 * to worry about how to manage data transfer between them, it is taken care of by
 * this class.  All the public functions here are thread safe, and if used correctly
 * tested to be deadlock free.
 *
 * The terminology here is a "frame" is a block of memory of size @c frame_size
 * and the buffer consists of a ring with @c num_frames independent frames.
 * When a frame is available for producers to add data to, it is considered "empty"
 * When a frame is ready to be read by consumers is it considered "full"
 * Therefore a producer asks for an "empty" frame, and marks it as "full" when done.
 * Likewise a consumer asks for a "full" frame and marks it as "empty" when done.
 *
 * There can be more than one producer or consumer attached to each buffer, but
 * each one must register with the buffer separately.
 *
 * Consumers must only read data from frames and not write anything back too them.
 * More than one producer can write to a given frame in a multi producer setup,
 * but in that case they must coordinate their address space to not overwrite
 * each others values.  Because of this multi-producers are somewhat rare.
 * Producers also generally shouldn't read from frames, although there is
 * nothing wrong with doing so, it just normally doesn't make sense to do so.
 *
 * Unless the function @c zero_frames() is called on the buffer object, the
 * default behaviour is not to zero the memory of the frames between uses.
 * Therefore it is normally upto the producer(s) to ensure all memory
 * values are either given new data, or zeroed.
 *
 * In the config file a buffer is created with a <tt>kotekan_buffer: standard</tt>
 * named block.   The buffer name becomes the path name of that config block.
 *
 * Note if no consumer is registered for on a buffer, then it will drop
 * the frames and log an INFO statement to notify the user that the data
 * is being dropped.
 *
 * @conf frame_size The size of the individual ring frames in bytes
 * @conf num_frames The buffer depth of size of the ring
 * @conf metadata_pool The name of the metadata pool to associate with the buffer
 *
 * See metadata.h for more information on metadata pools
