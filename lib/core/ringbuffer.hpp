/**
 * @brief A buffer to manage the signalling between stages when those
 * stages want to communicate data using a ring buffer.
 *
 * This class is a little strange in that it doesn't actually allocate
 * any memory!  It was created to connect GPU pipelines that need to
 * communicate via a ring buffer in GPU memory.  This class knows how
 * big the buffer is and controls read and write access for the
 * consumers and producers, but does not actually own the memory.
 *
 * Producers and consumers can produce or consume different numbers of
 * elements, so this is a helpful way of connecting stages that
 * operate at different cadences.
 *
 * In the yaml config file, one of these can be created by setting the
 * @c kotekan_buffer value to @c "ring".
 *
 * @conf ring_buffer_size: the number of elements in the ring buffer
 * @conf metadata_pool The name of the metadata pool to associate with the buffer
