/**
 * @class gpu_command
 * @brief Base class for defining openCL commands to execute on GPUs
 *
 * Commands executed on a GPU can either be kernels that perform a simple calculation
 * or resource management instructions to support kernel execution. Any openCL instruction
 * sent to a GPU requires a set of common support functions. The code common to all openCL classes has
 * been abstracted into this base class along with the signature of fundamental methods
 * a child class should implement when defining an openCL class.
 * 
 * This object and its subclasses is managed by a command_factory instance that initializes
 * memory resources and determines execution sequence.
 * 
 * 
 * @conf num_adjusted_elements     Number of elements on the telescope (e.g. 2048 - CHIME, 256 - Pathfinder).
 * @conf num_elements              Number of elements on the telescope (e.g. 2048 - CHIME, 256 - Pathfinder).
 * @conf num_local_freq            Number of frequencies per data stream sent to each node.
 * @conf samples_per_data_set      Total samples in each dataset. Must be a value that is a power of 2.
 * @conf num_data_sets             Number of independent integrations within a single dataset. (eg. 8 means samples_per_data_set/8= amount of integration per dataset.)
 * @conf num_adjusted_local_freq   Number of frequencies per data stream sent to each node.
 * @conf num_blocks                Calculated value: num_adjusted_elements/block_size * (num_adjusted_elements/block_size + 1)/2
 * @conf block_size                This is a kernel tuning parameter for a global work space dimension that sets data sizes for GPU work items.
 * @conf buffer_depth              Global buffer depth for all buffers in system. Sets the number of frames to be queued up in each buffer.
 * 
 * 
 * @todo    Clean up redundancy in config values used.
 * @todo    Add dynamic memory allocation logic.
 * @todo    Move some of the correlator specific config values into the correlator kernels.
 * @todo    Rename variables to frame where buffer is current used. In some cases, frame is the correct usage.
 * @todo    BufferID used when FrameID is more appropriate. Change this naming.
