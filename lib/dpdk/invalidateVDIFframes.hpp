/**
 * @brief Invalidate VDIF frames in the @c out_buf based on flags in the @lost_samples_buf
 *
 * Note the synchronization is a little non-standard here.  We wait for the buffer
 * which contains the flags to be full and register as a consumer on that buffer.
 * Because we know that will only happen once the data buffer is full, we can use
 * that as the synchronization on the data, and so can start zeroing data in the data
 * buffer (which we operate on as a producer).
 *
 * @par Buffers
 * @buffer out_buf Kotekan buffer with VDIF frame data already filled
 *     @buffer_format Array with blocks of @C sample_size byte time samples
 *     @buffer_metadata chimeMetadata
 * @buffer lost_samples_buf Array of flags which indicate if a sample in a given location is lost
 *     @buffer_format Array of flags uint8_t flags which are either 0 (unset) or 1 (set)
 *     @buffer_metadata chimeMetadata
