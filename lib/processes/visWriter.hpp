/**
 * @class visWriter
 * @brief Write the data out to an HDF5 file .
 *
 * This process operates in two modes, ``node_mode`` where it runs on a per-GPU
 * node basis (inferring its frequency selection from that) and writes a new
 * acquisition per node. Alternatively it can be run more generally, receiving
 * and writing arbitrary frequencies, but it must be given the frequency list in
 * the config.
 *
 * The products we are outputting must be specified correctly. This is done
 * using the same configuration parameters as `prodSubset`. If not explicitly
 * set `all` products is assumed.
 *
 * The output is written into the CHIME N^2 HDF5 format version 3.1.0.
 *
 * @par Buffers
 * @buffer in_buf The buffer streaming data to write
 *         @buffer_format visBuffer structured
 *         @buffer_metadata visMetadata
 *
 * @conf   node_mode        Bool (default: false). Run in ``node_mode`` or not.
 * @conf   file_type        String. Type of file to write. One of 'hdf5',
 *                          'hdf5fast' or 'raw'.
 * @conf   root_path        String. Location in filesystem to write to.
 * @conf   instrument_name  String (default: chime). Name of the instrument
 *                          acquiring data (if ``node_mode`` the hostname is
 *                          used instead)
 * @conf   freq_ids         Array of ints. The ids of the frequencies to write
 *                          out (only needed when not in @c node_mode).
 * @conf   input_reorder    Array of [int, int, string]. A description of the
 *                          inputs. Only the last two elements of each sub-array
 *                          are used and are expected to be @c channel_id and
 *                          @c channel_serial (the first contains the @c adc_id
 *                          used for reordering om ``visTransform``)
 * @conf   weights_type     Indicate what the visibility weights represent, e.g,
 *                          'inverse_var'. Will saved as an attribute in the saved
 *                          file. (default 'unknown')
 * @conf   write_ev         Bool (default: false). Write out the eigenvalues/vectors.
 * @conf   num_ev           Int. Only needed if `write_ev` is true.
 * @conf   file_length      Int (default 1024). Maximum number of samples to
 *                          write into a file.
 * @conf   window           Int (default 20). Number of samples to keep active
 *                          for writing at any time.
 * @conf   use_dataset_manager Bool (default:false). Use the dataset manager.
 *
 * @par Metrics
 * @metric kotekan_viswriter_write_time_seconds
 *         The write time of the HDF5 writer. An exponential moving average over ~10
 *         samples.
 * @metric kotekan_dataset_manager_dropped_frame_count
 *         The number of frames dropped while attempting to write.

/**
 * @class visCalWriter
 * @brief Extension to visWriter for exporting calibration data.
 *
 * This process is based off visWriter, but is meant for generating a
 * fixed-length ring-buffer-like file for storing the last samples of
 * the calibration data stream. To ensure consistent reads while the
 * process is continuously writing to a file, a REST endpoint is provided
 * that causes the process to stop writing and release the file for
 * reading. It will proceed with writing to a second file, until the
 * endpoint is called again and it moves back to the first file, and so on.
 *
 * @warning Since the writer starts from scratch when it switches files,
 *          if requests that are sent more frequently than the length of
 *          a file, the released file will be partially empty.
 *
 * @par REST Endpoints
 * @endpoint /release_live_file/process name>    ``GET`` Stop writing
 *           and make a file available for reading. Responds with a path to
 *           the file.
 *
 * @par Buffers
 * @buffer in_buf The buffer streaming data to write
 *         @buffer_format visBuffer structured
 *         @buffer_metadata visMetadata
 *
 * @conf   root_path        String. Location in filesystem to write to.
 * @conf   file_base        String. Base filename to buffer data in (omit ext).
 * @conf   dir_name         String. Name of directory to hold the above files.
 * @conf   node_mode        Bool (default: false). Run in ``node_mode`` or not.
 * @conf   instrument_name  String (default: chime). Name of the instrument
 *                          acquiring data (if ``node_mode`` the hostname is
 *                          used instead)
