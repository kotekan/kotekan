/**
 * @class restInspectFrame
 * @brief Exposes the binary contents of a buffer frame (or subset there of) to
 *        the REST server via a GET request.
 *
 * Returns the latest data copied into the internal frame @c frame_copy.
 * The length of this data is either the frame size, or the @c len config option
 * When returning data to the REST client, this class will not update @c frame_copy
 * So it's possible that if too many requests are made, it will keep returning the
 * same (old) frame contents.  This is a side effect of trying to prevent the system
 * from locking up the buffer itself.  We might want to adjust this someday, but for
 * testing this seems like a reasonable compromise.
 *
 * @par REST Endpoints
 * @endpoint /inspect_frame/<buffer name> ``GET`` Returns binary data from the
 *           latest frame in the buffer given in @p in_buf
 *
 * @par Buffers
 * @buffer in_buf Input kotekan buffer
 *     @buffer_format Any
 *     @buffer_metadata Any
 * @conf   len   Int. the amount of bindary data in bytes to return from the
 *               front of the latest frame. Default the frame size of @c in_buf
 *               Note if set to zero, this will be set to frame size of @c in_buf
 *
 * @warning This stage makes a copy of the data in each and every frame ( upto @c len ).
 *          So it should not be used in places where this extra memory copy would be
 *          expensive for the system to deal with, and should only be enabled when it
 *          is needed for trouble shooting.
 *
 * @todo Once the new buffers are implemented this should use the frame "freeze out"
 *       method instead of doing memory copies.
