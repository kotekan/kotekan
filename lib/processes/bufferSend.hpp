 * @brief Sends a buffer and metadata over TCP.

 * drop incoming frames, and try to reconnect to the server after @c reconnect_time
 * seconds.

 *
 * @config server_ip       String, the IP address of the server to send data too.
 * @config server_port     Int, default 11024. The port number on the remote server.
 * @config send_timeout    Int, default 20. The number of seconds
 *                         before @c send() times out and closes the connection.
 * @config reconnect_time  Int, default 5.  The number of seconds between
 *                         connection attempts to the remote server.
 *
 * @par Metrics
 * @metric kotekan_buffer_send_dropped_frame_count
 *         The number of frames dropped because @c send() is running too slow.
 *
 * @todo Add the rest of the comments here.
 * @todo we might also add counters for dropped frames because the connection
 *       is down, and frames that are lost because of connection errors.
