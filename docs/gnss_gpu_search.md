# Moving the acquisition search onto the GPU

*Scoped 2026-08-05. Baselines in here are measured on cf06 (2x L40S, 64 cores), not estimated.*

## 1. Why now, and what the real problem is

Every search speedup to date has been a *parameter* that buys latency by not searching:

| knob | live value | blind value | what it costs |
|---|---|---|---|
| `require_hint` | true | false | only PRNs the broker already found are searched at all |
| `nh_hint_span` | 2 (-> 5 alignments) | 20 alignments | 4x |
| `prns_per_pass` | 1 | 32 | 32x |
| `doppler` window | broker hint, a few bins | 321 bins | ~30x |
| `acquire_windows` | 1 | 4-64 | integration length |
| `acquire_fine_step` | 128 | 1 | 128x (this one is honest -- see 5q) |

That is why a live pass is 0.6 s: it is not a search, it is a *re-acquire of things already known*.
The instrument has no cold-start path that finishes in useful time, and every one of those
multipliers gets worse with a second constellation.

**Measured blind cost of the surface aggregate** (`scripts/gnss/aggbench`, cf06, 16 threads,
nc=79, n_dop=321, Mp=3125, sph=16384, fine_step=128):

    CPU direct : 0.667 s   121.6 GFlop/s   (81.1 GFlop)   <- per NH alignment, per window

x20 NH alignments = 13.3 s per PRN; x32 PRNs = **427 s per snapshot for GPS L5 alone**. That is
the historical 13-minute pass, and it is ~100% of it (5q: the surface is the entire cost).

The scaling that motivates this thread is worse than 32x, because the NH multiplier is
per-signal and L5 has the *short* secondary code:

| signal | sats | secondary length (the NH multiplier) |
|---|---|---|
| GPS L5 Q5 | 32 | 20 |
| Galileo E5a Q | 36 | 100 |
| BeiDou B2a Q | ~46 | 100 |
| GPS L1 C/A | 32 | 1 (but 1 ms code -> different Mp geometry) |

A blind all-constellation pass on CPU is hours. This is the wall.

## 2. What does NOT change

Two settled results constrain the design, and neither is being re-litigated:

* **The 20-way NH scan stands.** 5q derived an exact-looking restructure (one correlate ->
  all 20 alignments as sign-weighted sums of shifted copies) and it failed *on the
  representation*: the cross-channel reconstruction `D` is only approximate for the windowed
  PFB, and coherently summing copies at sub-hop offsets needs far more accuracy than localizing
  a peak does. Do not re-derive it. The GPU's answer to a 20x multiplier is to *be 200x faster*.
* **`acquire_fine_step` is the one honest reduction** and it is already taken (7.4x, 0.03 chips).

## 3. The one new algorithmic result: the fine axis is an exact DFT

    D(q,i) = sum_c P_c(q) e^{+i 2 pi f_c (i * s_step) / sph}

When `s_cols * s_step == s_stored` -- which is the live configuration exactly (128 * 128 =
16384) -- the ramp is `e^{+i 2 pi (f_c - f_0) i / s_cols}` up to a common unit-modulus factor
that `|D|^2` discards. It therefore depends on the channel **only through `(f_c - f_0)/g mod
s_cols`**. So: fold the `nc` channel values into an `s_cols`-length bin array, take one
`s_cols`-point inverse DFT. Not an approximation of the direct sum -- the direct sum,
reassociated.

    direct : nc * s_cols complex MAC = 79 * 128 * 8   = 80896 flop/row
    folded : nc adds + one 128-pt FFT ~ 5*128*log2(128) = 4480 flop/row      (18x fewer)

**This is not the reverted coarse fold of 5o.** That one assumed the *replica* was periodic in
the window and died on the NH overlay. This is an identity about the *ramp*; it assumes nothing
about the signal. `aggregate_folded` in `scripts/gnss/aggbench.cpp` refuses to run when its one
arithmetic precondition fails, rather than falling back to something close.

Validated at blind dimensions against the shipped `gnss::aggregate_accumulate`:

    max|diff| 2 vs surface max 1.0e7  -> rel 2.0e-07     (float round-off)
    argmax ref == fold == planted cell
    snr ref 63440.057  fold 63440.071

**But it is worth ~2.2x, not 18x, on either processor** -- because it stops being a flop problem
and becomes a bandwidth problem. Measured (see §5): CPU 0.507 -> 0.202 s, GPU 5.3 -> 2.5 ms. The
folded GPU kernel runs at **673 GB/s of the L40S's 864 GB/s peak**, i.e. it is within 22% of the
memory system and no further flop reduction can help it.

The fold's real value is therefore *not* the 18x. It is two things:

1. **It removes an 81 KB table.** The direct path needs the `[nc][s_cols]` ramp, which does not
   fit in shared memory at CHORD scale and so streams from L2 -- that is why the direct GPU
   kernel stalls at 312 GB/s. The folded path needs `nc` ints plus an `s_cols/2` twiddle table,
   both of which live in shared memory.
2. **It scales with `nc`.** Direct cost is linear in the channel count; folded is `nc` adds plus
   a fixed `s_cols`-point transform. At `nc = 79` that is 2.2x; a wider band at `nc = 200` makes
   it ~5x. Since the whole point of this thread is *other bands and constellations*, that
   asymptote is the reason to keep it.

## 4. Where the time actually goes, and what has to move

Per (PRN, NH alignment, window):

| step | cost | note |
|---|---|---|
| replica materialise | 0.002 s / 5 align | elementwise, already negligible |
| `FFT(data)` | recomputed per (PRN, NH) | **depends on neither** -- hoist, free 640x |
| correlate: `nc x n_dop` IFFTs of len 3125 | ~4.6 GFlop, 634 MB out | memory-bound |
| **aggregate** | **81 GFlop, 0.667 s** | **the whole cost** |
| peak (max/mean over 128M cells) | host scan of 1.03 GB | never needs to leave the device |

The live config also misses a free 2x: `doppler_step: 31.25` is *half* the transform's own bin
spacing `Fs/(Mp*sph)` = 62.5 Hz, so `channel_correlate_into`'s bin-aligned path (one forward FFT
serving every Doppler trial) is **not** being taken. On the GPU always use the bin-aligned grid;
the parabolic refine in `channelized_peak` already recovers sub-grid Doppler.

## 5. The GPU decomposition

The batch axes are enormous and independent: **PRN (32) x NH (20) x Doppler (321) x channel
(79)**. The Doppler x channel product alone is 25359 independent length-3125 transforms, which
saturates an L40S without touching the other two.

  4. aggregate    fold nc -> s_cols bins, 128-pt IFFT, accumulate |.|^2

```

**PCIe traffic per snapshot: 2 MB up, kilobytes down.** The 1.03 GB surface never crosses the
bus and is never scanned by the host -- which is a structural change, not just a speedup: today
the surface must be materialized in host RAM because that is where the peak search lives.

### MEASURED, A1 as built (cf06, one L40S, blind dimensions)

`aggbench --nd 321 --mp 3125 --threads 16 --reps 5 --gpu`:

| | time | rate | vs CPU |
|---|---|---|---|
| CPU direct (shipped `aggregate_accumulate`, 16 threads) | 0.507 s | 160 GFlop/s | 1x |
| CPU folded | 0.202 s | | 2.5x |
| GPU direct | 5.3 ms | 312 GB/s (compute-bound: the 81 KB ramp) | **84x** |
| **GPU folded** | **2.5 ms** | **673 GB/s of 864 peak** | **180x** |
| GPU peak+mean over 128M cells | 0.9 ms | 567 GB/s | (was a 1 GB host scan) |

Correctness at blind dimensions, against the double-precision CPU surface:

    gpu-direct : rel 0         argmax == planted cell   snr 63440.057  (CPU: 63440.057)
    gpu-folded : rel 2.99e-07  argmax == planted cell   snr 63440.077

So per (PRN, NH, window) the surface work is **3.4 ms against 507 ms**, and the peak amortizes
further when `acquire_windows > 1` (it runs once after all windows, not per window).

    blind GPS L5 aggregate+peak, 1 GPU : 20 NH x 32 PRN x 3.4 ms = 2.2 s   (vs ~324 s CPU)

Add the projected device correlate (~1.9 ms, bandwidth-bound on 1.3 GB) and a full blind
GPS L5 snapshot lands near **3.4 s on one GPU, ~1.7 s on both** -- against 427 s today. That is
the headroom to turn `require_hint` off and add constellations.

### Still to come: fusion (A4)

Steps 3-5 tile over Doppler so `P` never round-trips to HBM. A Doppler tile of 16 gives
`P_tile = 79 * 16 * 3125 * 8 B = 31.6 MB`, resident in the L40S's 48 MB L2. Since both kernels
are already bandwidth-bound, removing a 0.63 GB round trip is where the next factor lives -- not
in any further flop reduction.

## 6. Staging

Correctness first, throughput second -- the same G1a/G1b/G1c discipline the despread migration
used, and for the same reason: a search that is fast and subtly wrong is indistinguishable from
one that is slow, until weeks later.

* **A1 -- device aggregate + on-device peak. DONE 2026-08-05**, numbers above.
  `lib/cuda/cudaGnssAcquireKernel.{hpp,cu}`, driven by `scripts/gnss/aggbench --gpu`.
  *Not deployable alone*: `P` is 634 MB per NH, so shipping it over PCIe (~25 ms) would cost
  more than the 505 ms the kernel saves. A1 is a correctness milestone, not a release -- which
  is exactly why it was built against a planted peak and the double CPU surface rather than
  wired straight into the stage.
* **A2 -- device correlate.** Batched cuFFT + the hoisted `FFT(data)` + the bin-aligned Doppler
  shift. Now the whole (correlate -> aggregate -> peak) chain is device-resident and A1's win is
  real. This is the first deployable unit.
* **A3 -- batch over (PRN x NH)** in one launch set, replica materialise on device.
* **A4 -- fuse 3-5** with Doppler tiling for L2 residency.
* **A5 -- refine on GPU.** In *hinted* mode refine is 75% of the pass (0.48 s of 0.62 s), so it
  becomes the limiter the moment acquire is fast. It is exact despreads, which is what
  `GnssCudaDespread` / `cudaGnssDespreadKernel.cu` already do for the tracker -- reuse, do not
  rewrite.
* **A6 -- other signals.** Only after A2 is on sky, because a 100-length secondary code is a 5x
  larger NH multiplier and will find any remaining cost that scales with it.

## 7. Traps specific to this port

1. **Ramp sign.** The aggregate sums `e^{+i...}`; FFTW `FFTW_BACKWARD` and cuFFT `INVERSE` both
   match it. A planted test peak needs the *conjugate* ramp, or it lands at `s_cols - s0` --
   which is a correct answer to a different question, and looks like an indexing bug. (Hit this
   while writing `aggbench`.)
2. **The lag axis is the negative of physical delay** (5q). Any new indexing must be validated
   against a planted peak at a *known* cell, not against self-consistency.
3. **`s_stored` vs `sph`.** `s_stored` bounds the *range* of the fine lag; the ramp argument
   still divides by the full `sph`, and `tau = q*sph + i*s_step` uses `sph`. The live geometry
   has `g = 1` so `s_stored == sph` and the distinction is invisible -- it will not be for a
   comb with a common factor (airspy: g=2).
4. **Precision.** The CPU surface accumulates in `double`, the GPU will accumulate `float`. Over
   `acquire_windows` accumulations of `|D|^2` with `nc=79` this is fine, but it is a real
   difference and the validation must compare against the double reference at blind dimensions,
   not at toy ones.
5. **`CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` defaults to 86** (A40, the cx nodes). cf06's L40S is sm_89.
   An sm_86 cubin *runs* there (same major version) but is not Ada-optimal; set 89 for cf06.
6. **Reduction shape, not precision, was the peak kernel's problem.** It first ran at 195 GB/s
   and the obvious suspect was the FP64 accumulator (1/64 rate on an L40S). Converting the
   grid-stride partial to float changed nothing. The actual cause was 32 cells per thread
   followed by 8 `__syncthreads()` stages -- reducing cost as much as reading. 256 cells per
   thread: 195 -> 567 GB/s. Measure before attributing.
7. **`cudaDeviceProp::memoryClockRate` no longer exists in CUDA 13** (cf06 runs 13.3). Use
   `cudaDeviceGetAttribute(cudaDevAttrMemoryClockRate)`.

## 8. Reproducing the baseline

```
KBUILD=build_nodpdk scripts/gnss/build_tool.sh aggbench      # on cf06
scripts/gnss/aggbench --nd 321 --mp 3125 --threads 16        # blind dims, direct vs folded
scripts/gnss/aggbench --nd 5 --mp 400                        # fast correctness check
```

`build_tool.sh` now takes `KBUILD` (cf06 has no DPDK or testing lib) and writes `<tool>.<host>`
with a `<tool>` symlink, because `/home/kvand` is NFS-shared and two hosts building the same
tool clobbered each other -- which presents as "the tool suddenly segfaults".
