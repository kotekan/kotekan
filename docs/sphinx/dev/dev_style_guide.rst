File Organization
------------------

* ``kotekanProcess`` files should be placed in the **lib/processes/** folder,
  and named in *CamelCase* to match the process class they contain.

* Accelerator interfaces (such as e.g. OpenCL or CUDA) should create their own
  folder within **lib/**, for storage of kernel handling objects and the kernels
  themselves.

* Support scripts can be placed in the **script/** directory.

* Python components should be placed in the **python/** directory.

* Configuration (``yaml``) files should go in the **config/** folder.
