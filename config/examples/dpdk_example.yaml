# dpdk_example.yaml
#
# Example config for a simple DPDK setup, this config just captures packets from
# one DPDK port (including all headers/footers), and puts them in a buffer
# Nothing is done with the buffer other than printing the contents of the first
# packet in each frame to screen.
#
# Note all frames must be the same size, set by `packet_size`
